this is a note about learning github:

How to create a repository:
  git init
  (current directory)

How to add a gile:
  git add readme.txt
  git commit -m"wrote a readme file"
  (you can commit many files at one time)

To check the status:
  git status

To check what has been modified:
  git diff

To reset:
  git reset --hard (commit_id)
  (arguments:HEAD^ HEAD~100)

To view all changes:
  git log
  git log --pretty=oneline
  git reflog(to see which version to reset)

To return:
  git restore
  git reset HEAD <file>

To push:
  git push origin main
  (to push the latest modification)
